This repository contains an example of using delegates.

About this example:
---------------------------

A delegate is a pointer to set of methods.

There are two kinds of delegates:
1. `action()` which are usefull when we work with functions which doesn't returns any value `void`
2. `func()` which contains functions which returns a value 

Every kind (`action()` and `func()`) has many overloads, we can put up to 16 arguments in it.

You can alse write your own delegate by using modyfier `delegate`.
